## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### For Sensitive Vulnerabilities (Recommended)

**Please DO NOT open a public issue for sensitive security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report them privately using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/aviation-missions-app/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with detailed information

2. **Direct Contact**
   - Email: [Contact maintainer directly through GitHub profile]
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### For Non-Sensitive Security Issues

For general security improvements or non-exploitable issues, you can:
- Open a [security-related issue](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/aviation-missions-app/issues/new?template=security_report.yml)
- Start a [discussion](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/aviation-missions-app/discussions)

## üìã What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or other evidence
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
6. **Environment**: Version, deployment method, browser, etc.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity, typically 1-4 weeks
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Authentication**: Secure session management for admin functions
- **Container Security**: Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal attack surface
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies

### Automated Security Scanning

This project includes automated security scanning:

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Daily scans with Trivy and Dependabot
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis with CodeQL
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of exposed secrets
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking

## üîß Security Configuration

### Recommended Deployment Security

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Firewall**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
3. **Updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity
5. **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups
6. **Access Control**: Limit admin access and use strong passwords

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration should use environment variables:

```bash
# Don't hardcode in configuration files
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```
