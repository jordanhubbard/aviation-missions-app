- **Schema ID**: `https://aviation-missions.app/schemas/mission.json`
- **Title**: "Aviation Mission"
- **Type**: Object with strict validation (`additionalProperties: false`)

## Frontend Challenge Detection

The UI automatically analyzes mission content to identify flight challenges:

| Challenge | Keywords | Icon | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| Weather | weather, wind, turbulence, fog, visibility, cloud | üå§Ô∏è | Weather-related challenges |
| Navigation | navigation, gps, vor, ils, approach, departure | üß≠ | Navigation system usage |
| Communications | radio, communication, atc, tower, ground, clearance | üìª | Radio communication skills |
| Traffic | traffic, busy, crowded, multiple, aircraft, sequence | ‚úàÔ∏è | High-traffic environments |
| Emergency | emergency, malfunction, failure, problem, issue | üö® | Emergency procedures |
| Night Ops | night, dark, lighting, beacon, strobe | üåô | Night flying operations |
| Precision | precision, accuracy, exact, careful, tight | üéØ | Precision flying skills |
| Time Pressure | time, pressure, quick, fast, urgent, deadline | ‚è±Ô∏è | Time-critical operations |

## Data Sources

### Primary Source: missions.txt
The system parses a structured text file with the following format:

```
Mission Title (difficulty: X/10)
Objective: Learning objective here
Mission: Detailed mission description
Route: Flight route description
Suggested Route: ICAO codes and waypoints
Why: Educational rationale
Notes: Additional tips and considerations
```

### Database Storage
All parsed missions are stored in the H2 database with proper normalization and indexing for performance.

### API Responses
The REST API provides JSON responses with computed aggregations (comments, ratings, completions) joined from related tables.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Mission
```clojure
(create-mission! {
  :title "Pattern Practice at Busy Airport"
  :category "Airport Operations"
  :difficulty 3
  :objective "Improve pattern work in high-traffic environment"
  :mission_description "Fly pattern at KRHV during peak training hours"
  :why_description "Builds confidence in busy airport operations"
  :notes "Monitor CTAF carefully, announce intentions clearly"
  :pilot_experience "Beginner (< 100 hours)"
})
```

### Querying Missions by Difficulty
```sql
SELECT * FROM missions WHERE difficulty BETWEEN 1 AND 3 ORDER BY title;
```

### Getting Mission Statistics
```sql
SELECT 
  m.title,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as comments,
  COUNT(DISTINCT mc.id) as completions,
  AVG(CASE WHEN mr.rating = 'up' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as approval_rate
FROM missions m
LEFT JOIN comments c ON m.id = c.mission_id
LEFT JOIN mission_completions mc ON m.id = mc.mission_id  
LEFT JOIN mission_ratings mr ON m.id = mr.mission_id
GROUP BY m.id, m.title;
```
